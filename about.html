                            <p>
                                &emsp;Game developer and software engineer with a few years of experience striving to create great software for society. I'm a tech enthusiast, perfectionist, communicator, and passionate learner. I have knowledge in Web and Game development, UI design, and Robotics.
                                <a class="badge bg-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#aboutExtended" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="aboutExtended">Read more</a>
                            </p>
                            <div class="collapse mb-3" id="aboutExtended">
                                <p>
                                    &emsp;In a world ever-increasingly defined by quantity over quality, I aspire to create meaningful software that can inspire others and promote the well-being of society. As a Software Engineer, I understand and promote the idea of prototyping and analysing ideas before they're turned into code, as it leads to better written and performing programs with greater maintainability. For me, rewriting software is never not an option: If something isn't working, I at least consider rewriting it completely, making it more future-proof and expandable (you can only take the same car to the mechanic so many times before it justifies buying a new car). 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &emsp;In the information age, it's easy to come across bad pieces of advice, and developers need to be able to separate what works from what doesn't (not all StackOverflow posts will be able to resolve your problems, especially when your problem is derived from a lack of understanding of how the environment you're programing in works). To me, being a developer isn't about being able to program in a specific language, but in a specific paradigm: Coding in ASP.Net won't make one a better Spring Boot programmer, but understanding how the Model-View-Controller design pattern works makes it easier to learn the specific syntax of what will be tackled (that being not only the aforementioned languages but many others), usually taking a couple of days. However, developers usually seem eager to brag about the number of different programming languages they have used in the past, rather than focus on the different types of projects they have worked on before, which is what usually forces them to think outside the box. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &emsp;It's not uncommon to find developers stuck for several days in completely avoidable situations if the software had been better designed; And this is where the prototyping (Software Engineering) comes in. Time "lost" in prototyping, modelling, and designing the software is often translated into time "gained" in its developing stage, and though hard for some to comprehend, that is exactly my <span class="fst-italic">modus operandi</span> (way of doing things).

                <p>&emsp;As someone who lives the future more than the present, always planning my next move, when something major happens in my life, it becomes the perfect opportunity of trying something new and reinvent myself. After spending 4 years as an undergraduate student and working for almost three years for the Brazilian Robotics Olympiad with the sBotics simulator, I'm now aiming higher, trying to make a few things right as opposed to doing many different things.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Being divided in these last six years between web and game development, I've currently decided to dedicate myself to developing Unity applications, as I find them more challenging and enjoyable to code. Web development is fine, but after years of developing in Unity, I've noticed that game development is the true "frontier" of coding: You have to know Newtonian physics, lots of maths, optimization techniques, AI, and much, much more. I find it more exciting to code, as you are constantly pushing yourself to your own limits, and getting stuck is not a sign of "ignorance" (as I often felt when developing for the web), as in game development you often have to take a deep breath and think how to best code that specific functionality, rushing would only break the project in the long run.</p>
                <p class="m-0">&emsp;After a road trip in the midwest and the east coast, I became fascinated with the northeastern coast of North America (yes, even the climate, but especially the culture). Since then, I've immersed myself in Anglo culture, studied English non-stop until I became fluent in it. As such, I intend on searching for jobs in the region, better preparing this résumé for the North American job market. So to sum it up: Keep working with Unity, get some certificates to improve this résumé, and eventually make my way up north to North America.</p>
