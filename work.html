                            <br/>- Improving SEO metrics and PageSpeed scores;

                            In this position, although most of the time I'm involved in front-end duties, I often work on some back-end tasks as well.

                            I was contracted to adapt and improve my educational robotics simulation tool (sBotics) to the needs of OBR. Since then, I've been working with them to enhance the simulation platform and experience for their users. As a Unity Developer, I have several roles: 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>- Detecting and fixing bugs with tools such as Bugsnag;

                            <br/>- Integrating the simulator with its servers through API; 
                            <br/>- Ensuring this communication is done securely, implementing and testing security features to mask and protect requests;
                            <br/>- Making sure sBotics is up-to-date with all the needs of OBR; 
                            <br/>- Analysing if the code is performant and can run on many devices, always keeping the average Brazilian device in mind; 
                            <br/>- Running tests and using the profiler to detect underperforming code for future refactoring.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Besides being a developer, I'm also a voice in OBR, promoting simulated robotics in livestreams from time to time.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>Its entire architecture was carefully planned and implemented throughout the year to create a virtual robotics kit aimed at the K-12 range, making the task of building and programming robots fun and exciting.

                            Users in the simulator can build their robots to their liking and program them using either C# or R-educ, a friendlier language that utilizes a web-based transpiler (source-to-source compiler).

                        This project aimed at implementing and monitoring Robotics workshops in public schools of Natal, Brazil. Educational robotics can be thought of as an innovative tool that allows students involved in workshops to stimulate their investigative thinking, develop logical reasoning, motor coordination and assist in the learning of interdisciplinary content. With this project, we sought to allow teachers to feel more comfortable and encouraged to apply this tool, providing the necessary support in the preparation and execution of classes using robotics.

                    <div class="content" x-show="open" x-transition>
                        All around the planet, different population groups suffer from the lack of water, mainly driven by water wastage or mismanagement. This reality motivated the development of this platform, with the main objective of creating a water-saving culture among the students of Natal's IFRN Campus Central high school and community college. The app features a simple user interface, where every student or professor can take pictures of a water-related problem around the campus and report it to the water management department.
