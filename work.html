                            As a Unity Developer at OBR, I was initially contracted to adapt and improve my educational robotics simulation tool, sBotics. I have since been working with the organization to enhance the platform and user experience, and have continued to contribute as a volunteer since 2022. My responsibilities include detecting and fixing bugs, as well as implementing new features like new options and robots. I am also responsible for integrating the simulator with its servers via API.

                            To ensure secure communication, I implement and test security features to protect requests. I analyze the code to ensure it is performant and can run on a variety of devices, always keeping the average performance of Brazilian devices in mind. I use a profiler and run tests to identify underperforming code and plan for future refactoring. Beyond my development work, I also act as a voice for simulated robotics at OBR, occasionally participating in livestreams.

Its entire architecture was carefully planned and implemented over the year to create a virtual robotics kit for the K-12 age range, making the task of building and programming robots both fun and exciting. Users in the simulator can build their robots to their liking and program them using either C# or R-educ, a more user-friendly language that utilizes a web-based transpiler.

                        This project aimed at implementing and monitoring Robotics workshops in public schools of Natal, Brazil. Educational robotics can be thought of as an innovative tool that allows students involved in workshops to stimulate their investigative thinking, develop logical reasoning, motor coordination and assist in the learning of interdisciplinary content. With this project, we sought to allow teachers to feel more comfortable and encouraged to apply this tool, providing the necessary support in the preparation and execution of classes using robotics.

                        All around the planet, different population groups suffer from the lack of water, mainly driven by water wastage or mismanagement. This reality motivated the development of this platform, with the main objective of creating a water-saving culture among the students of Natal's IFRN Campus Central high school and community college. The app features a simple user interface, where every student or professor can take pictures of a water-related problem around the campus and report it to the water management department.
